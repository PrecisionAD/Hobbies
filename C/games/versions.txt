v1.0 - 01/15/2021
- Initial version of the game.

v1.1 - 02/02/2021
- Reworked setScores() completely to update scores for each player individually instead of sequentially.
- Created new printPlayers() function.

v1.1.1 - 02/03/2021
- Added comment to let the users know that a player was already updated.

v1.2 - 02/04/2021
- Added new function to compute and print the difference in points for each player in each round.

v1.2.1 - 02/05/2021
- Added skull emoji to lowest raking player.
- If a player is missing, it won't be printed.

v1.3 - 02/06/2021
- Reworked gameWith5() to have a switch statement.
- Added new option() that returns the menu option.
- Added adjustScore() that will modify a player's score.

v1.4.1 - 02/08/2021
- Updated documentation for various methods to be more precise about what each method does.
- New askInput() to eliminate duplicate code.

v1.5 - 02/09/2021
- Added new appendNewScores() in order to save some time. Originally, the file scores.txt was created and every game was saved to it. After the game ended, the complete file would be read which in the future would take longer and longer to read because of the increased size. Because of that, now the game will create a temp.txt file that will be appended to the scores.txt only at the end of the game and it will be removed from the directory as part of the clean up.

v1.5.1 - 02/11/2021
- Added new openFile() to eliminate redundant code and to open files from a single funtion instead of doing it throught the program.
- Minor documentation additions/edits.

v1.5.2 - 02/15/2021
- Fixed a logic error in the main game loop that prevented the game from ending after all rounds were completed.

v1.6 - 03/17/2021
- Created new sortResults() to sort the total scores in ascending order just so we can print at the end of the game the point differences between the players.
- Created new printDifferences() to print the differences in points from each players against the best player (the one who has the least amount of points).

v1.6.1 - 03/18/2021
- Changed struct name variable from char pointer to char array to avoid having to call free() at the end of the game. Because of that, changed the logic (deleted the malloc call in getNames() for the variable names in the player struct) to make it simpler.

v1.7 - 03/19/2021
- Reworked scoreDiff() to first sort the scores in a temp array and then use it to print the names in order compared to winning player.
- Deleted sortResults() and printDifference().

v1.7.1 - 03/19/2021
- Updated the way a score was modified to affect the player struct as well as the global array of scores when a manual correction was made.
- Added feature that displays more stars depending on the point difference between the second best player and the best player.

v1.7.2 - 04/01/2021
- Added comments to for clarity when printing certain values such as points.
- Added new colors when printing output to alert the user that changes were either ok or they need attention.

v1.7.4 - 04/05/2021
- Now the score table prints in color as well as the names.

v1.7.5 - 04/06/2021
- Added an extra check when trying to adjust a player's points when all scores are 0 (no round has been played yet).

v1.7.6 - 04/07/2021
- Fixed a typo in the comments.
- Adjusted the points needed to display more stars for the winning player.

v1.7.7 - 04/09/2021
- Added an option to print the table.

v1.7.8 - 04/10/2021
- Fixed bug preventing the game from finishing.

v1.7.9 - 04/10/2021
- Changed type of printDone() from void to int to save a couple lines of code when ending the game.
- Added a new line character after printing the table scores for better readability.
- Moved the 'round' variable that keeps track of the rounds played inside case 1 of the switch statement.

v1.7.9 - 
- Fixed a bug when printing the scores: if less than 6 players were playing, the negative score of the missing player (-1) was causing the printing to be out of order. Instead, only the existing players will be printed instead of printing all the players.

v1.8 - 05/07/2021
- Added new print out "Main Menu" to distinguish it from other options.
- Added new return option when trying to adjust a score (a mistake from the user, no need to adjust any score).

v1.8.1 - 05/08/2021
- Fixed some comments to reflect the changes made to the function.
- Increased char array space in bytes to align it with memory.

v1.8.2 - 05/11/2021
- Added the exit() call to the openFile() function to terminate the program if a file couldn't be openened.

v1.8.3 - 05/13/2021
- Added new field called "huevos" which will keep track the winner in each round. It will print along the difference in points.

v1.8.4 - 05/14/2021
- Moved the print out of 'Huevitos' to be before the stars in order to achieve alignment.

v1.8.5 - 05/15/2021
- Removed the writeFile() and placed inside the getNames() since both functions are only run once for the remainder of the program.
