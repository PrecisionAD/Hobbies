<h3>Telefunke Overview</h3>
<hr>
The game is rather simple: it keeps the scores of up to 6 players by printing a table after each round. To do this, the program uses a temporary file to save the scores and prints the same file. When the game ends after all rounds are completed, the temporary file (temp.txt) is appended to a master file (scores.txt) that keeps record of all the games.

<h3>How to Play</h3>
<hr>
The game is best played between 4 and 6 players. Regarless of the player count, one player recieves 13 cards and the rest recieve 12 cards. The player who has 13 cards starts the game.

The game consists of 7 rounds (which can be modified) that are:

<ul>

<li>3x3: 2 pairs of any denomination (e.g. 3 of clubs, 3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds)</li> 
<li>3x4: 1 pair of any denomination plus a straight flush of the same denomination</li> 
<li>4x4: 2 straight flushes of the same denomination</li>

<li>3x3x3: 3 pairs of any denomination</li> 
<li>3x3x4: 2 pairs of any denomination plus a straight flush of the same denomination</li> 
<li>3x4x4: 1 pair of any denomination plus a straight flush of the same denomination</li> 
<li>4x4x4: 3 straight flushes of either same or any denomination</li> 

</ul>

By pairs, we mean a hand game. The first round, which is 3x3, means that from the 12 cards you need to put together a minimum of 2 games of the same cards. As an example, you can put together the cards 3 of clubs, 3 of hearts, and 3 of diamonds as the first game and as the second game have Jack of clubs, Jack of diamonds, and Jack of spades.

The game starts when the player that has 13 cards throws away a card that he or she deems unneeded. The player to his/her right, will take a card from the deck (now this player has 13 cards) or the card that was thrown by the last player and throw away a card that is not needed.

The last round is recommended to be of any denomination as a start; once the players feel comfortable with how the game should be, the straight flushes can be of the same denomination.
