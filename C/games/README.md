<h3>Telefunke Overview</h3>
<hr>
The game is rather simple: it keeps the scores of up to 6 players by printing a table after each round. To do this, the program uses a temporary file to save the scores and prints the same file. When the game ends after all rounds are completed, the temporary file (temp.txt) is appended to a master file (scores.txt) that keeps record of all the games.




<h3>How to Play</h3>
<hr>
The game is best played between 4 and 6 players. Regarless of the player count, one player recieves 13 cards and the rest recieve 12 cards. The player who has 13 cards starts the game.

The game consists of 7 rounds (which can be modified) that are:

<ul>

<li>3x3: 2 pairs of any denomination (e.g. 3 of clubs, 3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds)</li> 
<li>3x4: 1 pair of any denomination plus a straight flush of the same denomination</li> 
<li>4x4: 2 straight flushes of the same denomination</li>

<li>3x3x3: 3 pairs of any denomination</li> 
<li>3x3x4: 2 pairs of any denomination plus a straight flush of the same denomination</li> 
<li>3x4x4: 1 pair of any denomination plus a straight flush of the same denomination</li> 
<li>4x4x4: 3 straight flushes of either same or any denomination</li> 

</ul>

The game starts when the player that has 13 cards throws away a card that he or she deems unneeded. The player to his/her right, will take a card from the deck (now this player has 13 cards) or the card that was thrown by the last player and throw away a card that is not needed.

The last round is recommended to be of any denomination as a start; once the players feel comfortable with how the game should be, the straight flushes can be of the same denomination.
