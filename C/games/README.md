<h4>Telefunke</h4>

The game is rather simple: it keeps the scores of up to 6 players by printing a table after each round. To do this, the program uses a temporary file to save the scores and prints the same file. When the game ends after all rounds are completed, the temporary file is appended to a master file that keeps record of all the games.
